*NovelAI* supports native operating system [hotkeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_shortcut) and browser hotkeys, as well as its own useful shortcuts. Each of these is listed in this section for quick reference.

## Context Menus

Greatly assisting accessibility, *NovelAI* utilizes **a custom context menu** to provide users with quick actions. Simply **double clicking** on text in the main text box provide you with a number of helpful options. The Context Menus are also able to be used in conjunction with the rest of the selection-based shortcuts listed in this document.

- The first four buttons allow you to make the text **bold**, **italicized*, **underlined** or **struck through**. This is purely cosmetic and has no effect on generation.
- The |in| button requests an inline generation at the cursor position. If you have selected text, the text will be replaced with the generation.
- The üó£Ô∏è button requests Text to Speech to read the highlighted text.
- Clicking the Menu Extension button (Œû) will open the full context menu.

- **Special characters** allows you to quickly add symbols that may not be easily typed on your keyboard and have specific uses in the finetune.
- **Add to...** allows you to add the highlighted text to **Memory**, **Author's Note** or **Lorebook Entries.**
- **Generate Lore** allows you to quickly request a lore generation, using the highlighted text as a prompt for the entry type.
