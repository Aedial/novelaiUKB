## Color Coding

The nature of *NovelAI* means it could be difficult to discern the AI's
text from your own - and that's where Color Coding comes in. This simple
system **adjusts the color of your Story** depending on **how the text
came to be**.

Within the default **Theme**, the colors will be as follows:

| Source         | Color |
|----------------|-------|
| Initial Prompt | Cream |
| AI Generated   | White |
| User Edited    | Green |
| User Input     | Blue  |

If you want to make *all* of your text the same color, you may disable text highlight in your user settings.

## About Themes

**Themes** allow you to bring a high level of customization to your
*NovelAI* experience. **Themes** allow you to instantly change the look
of the entire [**front end**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_and_back_end) with the
click of a button! There are a number of Themes to choose, all available
in the **Customization** section of the **Options Menu**, accessible
from the **Story Library** panel.

You can also download custom themes that may use custom backgrounds and fonts from the NovelAI Discord.

Remember - you can always **reset the Theme to its defaults** by
clicking the option in the top right of the Theme Editor.

  the interface.

  which you type.
- The **Dark Background** color, used for the dark-tinted parts of the
  interface.

A CSS Editor is also available so you can tinker with every style element of the page as you see fit.
