This page serves to catalogue interesting tags for image generation, which can lead to useful behavior, or have unusual effects that can be exploited **reliably**.


## Tags and Tag Combos

> prismatic

Leads to gem-like and colorful elements. Can be combined with specific objects or facial features. Is rather strong, so it is better used with some weakening.

> freckled skin

Much more reliable and artifact-free freckles. Generally subtle, cheeks/shoulders.

> braces + fangs / sharp teeth / razor teeth

Generally leads to more detailed sharp teeth that are more consistently shaped.

> rigid teeth

"Cringing" or gritting teeth. Without facial expression, generally has a note of disgust/disappointment.

> lion hair

Very voluminous and wild hair like you'd expect out of a lion girl's mane. Animal ears will tend to generate, so put them in UC if you don't want them.

> shaped pupils

Usually leads to white/light colored pupils with dense iris detail.

> X-Y-Z-hair

Can be used for tri-tone hair. Order is not always respected, and it generally goes from tips to roots.

> Detailed Skin

As opposed to "Detailed" which often damages quality by itself, this can lead to faces with greater texturing and more fancy-looking eyes. Tends to give lipstick to characters, so Lipstick can be put in UC.

## Magic UCs

> petite,loli

Severely reduced youthfulness for all. Should always be used when generating anyone adult-looking.

> 幼児化

Infantilization in Japanese. Adds maturity to the subject.

> claw

Gives softer angles and shape to fingers.

> tears

Reduces eye artifacts when using tags like `colored eyelashes, eyeliner, eyeshadow`

> sanpaku

Seems to break away from "NAIDiffusion style" with default quality tags. More detailed eyes.

> jpeg artifacts

Already in default UC but worth reinforcing when using very low scale and more painterly styles like `watercolor, ink sketch`
