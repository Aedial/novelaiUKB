Also known as the "left panel", this part of the interface controls everything **outside of your Story**. This includes the **Settings** menu, as well as the **list of your Stories**.

The **cog icon** (**⚙️**) contains the **[Account Settings](Account-Settings)** menu, and is also where you can **log out**.
The **Goose** (**🦆**) contains the **[Tools](Tools)** menu, which includes **Module Training and Tokenizer**, the link to **Image Generation**, as well as the **Official Documentation and Tutorial**.

Below them is the **Search Field** (**🔍**), along with the **Sort Menu** (**🔻**) which allows you to search through your Story collection.

### Story List

You can switch to a Story by simply clicking on it in the Story Library's list.

A new Story can be started by selecting the **New Story** button (**➕**), found at the bottom of the Story Library.

You can also directly import a prompt by using the **Import File** button. (**📩**)

**New Shelf 📔** allows you to create a shelf. Effectively, they are **story folders**. They are displayed on top of the list by default, and can have their title and description edited as well.

Every Story displays its **Title**, **Description**, the **date it was last edited**, and whether or not it is marked as a **Favorite ❤️**. The Title and Description can be modified by switching to the Story, then adjusting them in the **Story Settings** (📝).

If your story is hosted on the servers, it will also have a little cloud icon at the bottom right to symbolize that. (**☁️**) A checkmark will appear in it if it is successfully synchronized, otherwise, it will be crossed out.

A paperclip (**📎**) means the story is using the **Experimental Story Editor**.

Selecting a story will show four buttons: 🗑️ **Delete**, 📚 **Duplicate**, 📩 **Export/Download** and 📝 **Edit**.

When clicking **Edit**, you will open the **Story Settings Menu**.

In this menu, you may edit the following:

- The **Story Title**, shown in the library. Click 🎲 to generate a title for the story based on its contents.
- The **Story Description**, shown under the title in the library.
- Which **Shelf** the story belongs to.
- Which **Tags** are used to make the story searchable.

To enter tags, type the tag then press ENTER. Clicking an already entered tag will remove it from the list.
