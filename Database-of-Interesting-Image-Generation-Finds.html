<p>This page serves to catalogue interesting tags for image generation, which can lead to useful behavior, or have unusual effects that can be exploited <strong>reliably</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="tags-and-tag-combos">Tags and Tag Combos</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>prismatic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leads to gem-like and colorful elements. Can be combined with specific objects or facial features. Is rather strong, so it is better used with some weakening.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>freckled skin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much more reliable and artifact-free freckles. Generally subtle, cheeks/shoulders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>braces + fangs / sharp teeth / razor teeth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally leads to more detailed sharp teeth that are more consistently shaped.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>rigid teeth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Cringing" or gritting teeth. Without facial expression, generally has a note of disgust/disappointment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lion hair</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very voluminous and wild hair like you'd expect out of a lion girl's mane. Animal ears will tend to generate, so put them in UC if you don't want them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>shaped pupils</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usually leads to white/light colored pupils with dense iris detail.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>X-Y-Z-hair</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can be used for tri-tone hair. Order is not always respected, and it generally goes from tips to roots.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detailed Skin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As opposed to "Detailed" which often damages quality by itself, this can lead to faces with greater texturing and more fancy-looking eyes. Tends to give lipstick to characters, so Lipstick can be put in UC.</p>
<h2 id="magic-ucs">Magic UCs</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>petite,loli</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Severely reduced youthfulness for all. Should always be used when generating anyone adult-looking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>幼児化</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Infantilization in Japanese. Adds maturity to the subject.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>claw</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gives softer angles and shape to fingers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tears</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reduces eye artifacts when using tags like <code>colored eyelashes, eyeliner, eyeshadow</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>sanpaku</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems to break away from "NAIDiffusion style" with default quality tags. More detailed eyes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>jpeg artifacts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Already in default UC but worth reinforcing when using very low scale and more painterly styles like <code>watercolor, ink sketch</code></p>
