<p>This page lists specific tools provided by NovelAI.</p>
<h1 id="anlas">Anlas</h1>
<p>All tools that create content, such as images, or modules, require <strong>Anlas</strong>, NovelAI's generative currency. The term comes from the Turkish word for "Understanding".</p>
<p>You get a <strong>renewable stipend</strong> of Anlas per subscription period. This is <strong>not</strong> a fixed amount per month, instead, your amount of "<strong>Free Anlas</strong>" is refilled to 1.000(Tablet, Scroll) or 10.000(Opus) every month. Any <strong>Anlas</strong> not spent is lost, so make sure you use them every month.</p>
<p><strong>Anlas</strong> that are specifically bought directly never expire and remain forever until used.</p>
<h1 id="module-training">Module Training</h1>
<p><strong>Consult <a href="Datasetting-for-AI-Modules.html">Datasetting for AI Modules</a> for more information on how to prepare files for Module training.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AI Module training</strong> can be accessed from the <em>Story Library</em>, then clicking on the Goose button (<strong>ðŸ¦†</strong>), then <strong>Module Training</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/TapwaveZodiac/novelaiUKB/assets/35267604/62e5e81f-7189-45dd-bd59-cef3671cb107" alt="image" /></p>
<p>The left part of the interface contains the <strong>dataset</strong>. Files supported are <em>raw text <strong>only</strong>, encoded in <strong>UTF-8</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Upload all the files necessary for your module with the <strong>Select File</strong> button. Give your module a <strong>Name and Description</strong> on the right-hand side.</p>
<p>Choose the model that your module is for. <strong>Modules for Sigurd are not compatible with Euterpe!</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Total # of steps needed to train:</strong> field will display the estimate number of steps for <em>100% coverage of all text files.</em> It is not necessary to set the number of training steps to that number. A good soft limit is <strong>~3000 steps.</strong> You may also overfit your module by using more than the estimate.</p>
<p>This can have problematic or useful effects depending on what you seek to achieve.</p>
<p>Select the number of steps using the slider, then click <strong>Train!</strong> to start the training. It will take several minutes before the module is produced. Once done, you can save it and import it like any other story, scenario or generation set.</p>

<h1 id="tokenizer">Tokenizer</h1>
<p><img src="https://github.com/TapwaveZodiac/novelaiUKB/assets/35267604/e9fab4cc-4a9c-4c51-ad3f-d1de1d4ee9c9" alt="image" /></p>
<p>The <em>Tokenizer</em> is a feature that allows you to check how your text is split into tokens before being sent to the AI. It can be accessed by pressing ALT+T or clicking on the Goose button (<strong>ðŸ¦†</strong>), then then "Tokenizer".</p>
<p>The <strong>Text</strong> tab will highlight each token in sequence, using a different color to make it more visible.</p>
<p><strong>Token IDs</strong> will display the Token Identification Code that the AI uses. This is very useful for banning specific tokens (without any space addition and case insensitivity) using <strong>Ban Token ID</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="token-probability-viewer">Token Probability Viewer</h1>
<p><img src="https://github.com/TapwaveZodiac/novelaiUKB/assets/35267604/3ed3c18a-65e4-49c0-bd33-e54963f8763f" alt="image" /></p>
<p><strong>To enable this feature, you must enable it in the AI Settings panel of the Account Settings window. This will create a ðŸ§ Â button, which lets you access the Probability Viewer.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Token Probability Viewer</strong> is a powerful diagnosis tool that ,allows you to see what choices the AI considers before committing to a generation. This is hugely useful for fine-tuning generation settings, and checking why the AI keeps outputting the same response.</p>
<p>The left side of the interface displays the response text. You can ,switch between displaying the text proper, or the Token IDs. Cooler ,colors represent tokens with a low likelihood to appear, while hotter ,colors represent tokens highly likely to appear.</p>
<p>If you click a token, the right panel will update to show you tokens that were considered by the AI, before the generation settings, biases, ,bans and modules and after them.</p>
<p>Only the 10 most likely tokens are shown. The remainder is grouped up as a whole entity to save on processing time.</p>
