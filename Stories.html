<p>Also known as the "left panel", this part of the interface controls everything <strong>outside of your Story</strong>. This includes the <strong>Settings</strong> menu, as well as the <strong>list of your Stories</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>cog icon</strong> (<strong>⚙️</strong>) contains the <strong><a href="Account-Settings.html">Account Settings</a></strong> menu, and is also where you can <strong>log out</strong>. The <strong>Goose</strong> (<strong>🦆</strong>) contains the <strong><a href="Tools.html">Tools</a></strong> menu, which includes <strong>Module Training and Tokenizer</strong>, the link to <strong>Image Generation</strong>, as well as the <strong>Official Documentation and Tutorial</strong>.</p>
<p>Below them is the <strong>Search Field</strong> (<strong>🔍</strong>), along with the <strong>Sort Menu</strong> (<strong>🔻</strong>) which allows you to search through your Story collection.</p>
<h3 id="story-list">Story List</h3>
<p>You can switch to a Story by simply clicking on it in the Story Library's list.</p>
<p>A new Story can be started by selecting the <strong>New Story</strong> button (<strong>➕</strong>), found at the bottom of the Story Library.</p>
<p>You can also directly import a prompt by using the <strong>Import File</strong> button. (<strong>📩</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>New Shelf 📔</strong> allows you to create a shelf. Effectively, they are <strong>story folders</strong>. They are displayed on top of the list by default, and can have their title and description edited as well.</p>
<p>Every Story displays its <strong>Title</strong>, <strong>Description</strong>, the <strong>date it was last edited</strong>, and whether or not it is marked as a <strong>Favorite ❤️</strong>. The Title and Description can be modified by switching to the Story, then adjusting them in the <strong>Story Settings</strong> (📝).</p>
<p>If your story is hosted on the servers, it will also have a little cloud icon at the bottom right to symbolize that. (<strong>☁️</strong>) A checkmark will appear in it if it is successfully synchronized, otherwise, it will be crossed out.</p>
<p>A paperclip (<strong>📎</strong>) means the story is using the <strong>Experimental Story Editor</strong>.</p>

<p>Selecting a story will show four buttons: 🗑️ <strong>Delete</strong>, 📚 <strong>Duplicate</strong>, 📩 <strong>Export/Download</strong> and 📝 <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>
<p>When clicking <strong>Edit</strong>, you will open the <strong>Story Settings Menu</strong>.</p>
<p>In this menu, you may edit the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Story Title</strong>, shown in the library. Click 🎲 to generate a title for the story based on its contents.</li>
<li>The <strong>Story Description</strong>, shown under the title in the library.</li>
<li>Which <strong>Shelf</strong> the story belongs to.</li>
<li>Which <strong>Tags</strong> are used to make the story searchable.</li>
</ul>
<p>To enter tags, type the tag then press ENTER. Clicking an already entered tag will remove it from the list.</p>
